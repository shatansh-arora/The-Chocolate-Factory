1. Project Title / Headline
   
🍫 THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY: SALES PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD A Power BI solution designed to track chocolate shipments, monitor revenue trends, and evaluate sales team efficiency for the given dataset.

3. Short Description / Purpose
The Chocolate Factory Dashboard transforms raw shipment logs into a professional analytical tool. It is built to visualize $10M+ revenue stream, identify seasonal trends, and isolate high-performing products using dynamic, interactive visuals.

4. Tech Stack
🖥️ Power BI Desktop: The main tool I used to pull in the data, clean up the mess, and build the actual report.
🔢 DAX & Aggregates: Simple math used to calculate the big totals, like how much money we made (Revenue) and how many boxes were shipped.
🎨 Conditional Formatting: I set up "rules" so that the charts change color automatically—this makes the best and worst performers jump out at you.
📇 New Card Visual: Those big, easy-to-read numbers at the top used for showing the most important stats (KPIs).

5. Data Source
Source: Internal Excel-based shipment records.

Data Structure: Transaction-level data including Salesperson, Product, Geography (Country), Shipment Date, Amount, and Box counts.

5. Features / Highlights
Business Problem: Managing 5,000+ individual shipments across multiple countries makes it impossible to see performance trends without a visual aggregator.
Goal of the Dashboard: To create an automated "one-stop-shop" for:
Tracking monthly revenue fluctuations.
Monitoring salesperson ranking.
Identifying geographical revenue concentration.

Walkthrough of Key Visuals:
KPI Summary (Card Visuals): Displays the two most vital metrics—Total Amount and Total Boxes—to provide an immediate business snapshot.
Monthly Revenue Trend (Area Chart): A time-series visual showing the "Sum of Amount" across 2023 and 2024, helping identify peaks and troughs in chocolate demand.
Geographic Distribution (Donut Chart): Breaks down sales by country, showing which regions (like the UK or USA) dominate the market share.
Salesperson Leaderboard (Table): A formatted list ranking staff by revenue. Includes Data Bars for a quick visual comparison of how much each person contributed to the total.
Product Performance (Clustered Bar Chart): Lists products by revenue. Features Conditional Coloring where bars change to a specific highlight color if revenue exceeds a $1.5M threshold.
Interactive Slicers: A date range slicer that allows the user to filter the entire "Chocolate Factory" report for specific months or years.

6. Business Impact & Insights
Operational Clarity: Moving from raw spreadsheets to "The Chocolate Factory" dashboard allows for instant identification of the top 3 salespeople.
Targeted Product Analysis: The color-coded bar chart immediately flags underperforming vs. overperforming products, allowing for better inventory and marketing decisions.
Data-Driven Geography: The donut chart reveals regional sales density, informing where the logistics team should focus their efforts.
