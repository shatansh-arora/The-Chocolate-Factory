1. Project Title / Headline
   
🍫 THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY: SALES PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD A Power BI solution designed to track chocolate shipments, monitor revenue trends, and evaluate sales team efficiency for the given dataset.

2. Short Description / Purpose
   
The Chocolate Factory Dashboard transforms raw shipment logs into a professional analytical tool. It is built to visualize $10M+ revenue stream, identify seasonal trends, and isolate high-performing products using dynamic, interactive visuals.

3. Tech Stack
   
🖥️ Power BI Desktop: Served as the primary development environment for end-to-end ETL processes, data modeling, and report orchestration.

🔢 DAX & Aggregates: Utilized for the implementation of calculated measures to derive critical business metrics, including total revenue and shipment volume.

🎨 Conditional Formatting: Integrated logic-based visual rules to dynamically highlight performance variances and key outliers across charts and tables.

📇 New Card Visual: Leveraged for high-level KPI tracking, providing an immediate executive summary of core organizational metrics.

4. Data Source
   
📂 Source: I used internal Excel files that track every single chocolate shipment.

🏗️ Data Structure: The data is organized by "transactions," meaning every row is a real sale. It includes:

👤 Salesperson: Identifies the specific representative responsible for the transaction.

🍫 Product: Specifies the individual SKU or chocolate variety associated with the shipment.

🌍 Geography: Defines the target country or regional market for the fulfillment.

📅 Shipment Date: Records the precise timestamp of the transaction for temporal analysis.

📦 Boxes: Captures the total fiscal revenue and the physical unit volume per shipment.

💰 Amount : Denotes total amount of money.

5. Features / Highlights
   
📉 Business Problem: Looking at 5,000+ rows of shipment data in a spreadsheet is a nightmare. You can't see the "big picture" or tell if the business is growing or shrinking just by scrolling.

🎯 Goal of the Dashboard: I built The Chocolate Factory to be a simple, automatic "all-in-one" tool to:

   * Monthly Revenue Analysis: Provides a longitudinal view of cash flow and revenue fluctuations to identify seasonal trends and fiscal performance.
   * Personnel Benchmarking: Facilitates a direct comparative analysis of the sales force, clearly distinguishing high-performing individuals from those failing to meet quotas.
   * Market Penetration Tracking: Pinpoints exact geographic regions with the highest sales density, allowing for data-backed decisions on market expansion and resource allocation.
